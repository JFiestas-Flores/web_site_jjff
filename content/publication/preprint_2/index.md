abstract: Environmental valuation of water and land reclamation activities is one of the many fields where state preferences can provide useful insights for policy-makers. However, Social Desirability Bias (SDB) should be considered as respondents may give an answer to project a good image of themselves. This paper explores the usefulness of Inferred Valuation (IFV) to mitigate SDB in a choice experiment that assesses the willingness to pay (WTP) and willingness to accept (WTA) to treat polluted water from mining activities in Alberta, Canada. We find that IFV does mitigate the SDB by reducing/increasing the reported WTP/WTA, however, we find that the reference groups have a significant effect on the respondent's IVF, as well as their perception of the reference's group income. Additionally, we find that respondents value the treatment time more that the quality of the treated waster. Our results are consistent over different specifications and show that IVF can be a useful tool for state preferences.
