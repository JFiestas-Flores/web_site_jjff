abstract: Although in the last decades the number and complexity of studies related to veganism has increased exponentially (Salehi et al., 2023), the focus has been in develop countries. As there is a lot to explore about the subject in developing countries, this study explores three sets of instruments based on Rosenfeld and Burrowâ€™s (2018) to determine dietary self-identification (or label) and dietary patterns of consumers in Peru. Three in person surveys were conducted by the company Ipsos between August and November 2022. Each survey interviewed a national representative sample of 1000 participants. As found in other studies (Kirsten et al., 2020), self-categorization in Peru does not necessarily correspond the eating behaviour. For our best set of instruments, eating behavior estimates that around 4% and 1.5% of Peruvians can be identified as vegetarian and vegans, respectively. These values are lower when compared to the self-identification answers (5% and 2%), showing that only focusing on self-identification could over-estimate slightly the population. However, we recommend using both instruments as they provide helpful information for policies and campaigns. Furthermore, the study also finds that 27% of self-identified omnivores do not eat red meat, while 20% do not consume dairy, which can help activists to allocate more efforts in providing plant-based alternatives for these products. Additionally, we find that vegans do are not from a high socio-economic status, which could mean that policies to promote healthy plant-based options could be adopted by low-income populations.
